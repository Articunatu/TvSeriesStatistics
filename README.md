# TvSeriesStatistics

The purpose of this application is to get an gather an average of critics score for television drama shows, while also calculating an average audience score for anime shows that have all their scores displayed individually for each season.

From a technical perspective this project is made to showcase a view-first structure when using the DotNet framework for full-stack development, rather than the more common MVC-patterns.
Queries can be written directly in the view components, without commiting to the biggest security risks.
